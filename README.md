# LEDCloud
The HTML, CSS, Javascript and Arduino files for my LED Cloud Web Application.
I created this Web Application with the purpose of being used on a mobile phone to control an LED Cloud I built from an LED Strip, paper lanters, and polyfil.
I used arduino IDE and C to control the WS218 LED Strip from an ESP8266 Web Server. Which I coded in HTML, Javascript, and CSS with some help from bootstrap and jquery.
