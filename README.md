# LEDCloud
The HTML, CSS, Javascript and Arduino files for my LED Cloud Web Application.
I created this Web Application with the purpose of being used on a mobile phone to control an LED Cloud I built from an LED Strip, paper lanters, ESP8266, polyfil, anbd a power supply.
I used arduino IDE and C to control the WS218 LED Strip from an ESP8266 Web Server. Which I coded in HTML, Javascript, and CSS with some help from bootstrap and jquery.

Here is a picture of the general layout of the app. The actual webpage itself is disabled as long as the cloud is off in order to ensure that commands are not sent to the server
without it on. You can use the color wheel to choose a custom color and the background will change color to give you a sense of what color you are chooisng.
Otherwise, below that are some popular presets, then you have the brightness bar, and patterns.
Currently there are 12 patterns, and some patterns allow for custom colors.

This is the cloud itself after being hungup and plugged in.
